In the past, I have worked as a researcher in the linguistic research project [LinkType](http://linktype.iaa.uni-jena.de/) (corpus-based typology of clause linkage), where I have developed the [architectural prototype](http://corpus-tools.org/atomic) of a highly extensible annotation tool for multi-layer linguistic corpora.

As a consultant, I also develop software for research projects such as [TraCES](https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/) (late-antiquity to medieval Ethiopic) and [GiesKaNe](https://gieskane.com/) (basic syntactic structures of New High German).
