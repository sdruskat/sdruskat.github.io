# Integrated Systemic Research Software Intelligence

I define **Integrated Systemic Research Software Intelligence (ISRSI)** as a software engineering research
paradigm that combines software engineering methods, machine learning and artificial intelligence
to provide systemic insights into sets of software projects. It enables system-level software intelli-
gence that supports governance, decision-making, strategical planning, etc., for research software
ecosystems or organizations and their units.

To examine the term “Integrated Systemic Research Software Intelligence” more closely:

- *Integrated* refers to the combination and integration of analyses of sets of software projects
and processes within the given system on different aspects, e.g., software quality, security,
readiness, compliance, maintainability, sustainability, impact, etc.
- *Systemic* refers to the focus of intelligence-gathering on the level of systems, i.e., ecosystems
or organizations and their units.
- *Research Software* refers to the focus on research software as defined in [[1]](#ref1), which, due to the
specific preconditions of its development, maintenance and operation, benefits particularly
from a systemic view.
- *Intelligence* refers to the holism of the provided knowledge, i.e., the potential for abstraction
and access to system properties beyond the sum of its parts.

ISRSI combines the following methods and paradigms in particular to create, prepare and consolidate datasets to make them accessible and usable.

- Repository, data and metadata mining;
- empirical and evidence-based software engineering;
- automated software engineering;
- software analytics;
- machine learning;
- artifical intelligence;
- data science.
