## Research interests

- Research software citation
- Research software sustainability
- Research software publication
- Research software metadata

For my **PhD**, I'm developing a way to measure the impact of dependencies on research software, 
to enable transitive credit and make [hidden but important research dependencies](https://xkcd.com/2347/) more visible.

## Education

I have received my **Magister Artium (MA)** in English (major), Modern German Literature, and General and German Linguistics (minor) from the [Free University Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) in 2010.

## Personal

I live in Berlin, Germany, with my partner and our three kids.
