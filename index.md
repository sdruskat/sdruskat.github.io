I am a doctoral researcher in computer science at the [Institute of Software Technology](https://www.dlr.de/sc/en/) of the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/EN/Home/home_node.html) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/), [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), and a Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk/).

My **research interests** are:

- Software citation
- Research software sustainability
- Software publication
- Software metadata

For my **PhD**, I'm developing a way to measure the impact of dependencies on research software, 
to enable transitive credit and make [hidden but important research dependencies](https://xkcd.com/2347/) more visible.

Additional **projects** I currently work on include:

- [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) -
A human- and machine-readable file format for software citation metadata
- [HERMES](https://software-metadata.pub/) -
Automating software publication with rich metadata via continuous integration

Beyond these, I am **active in** teaching researchers basics of research software engineering as a Certified Instructor of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) (since 2019), and in helping establish the role of research software engineer in Germany and beyond as a co-founder and ex-board member of [de-RSE - Society for Research Software](https://de-rse.org/en/) and German delegate in the [International Council of RSE Associations](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html).

In the past I have worked as a [research software engineer](https://de-rse.org/en/) in a number of research [projects](/projects/) in linguistics and the digital humanities, and as Managing Editor at Wiley-Blackwell.

I have received my **Magister Artium (MA)** in English (major), Modern German Literature, and General and German Linguistics (minor) from the [Free University Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) in 2010.

I live in Berlin, Germany, with my partner and our three kids.
