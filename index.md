I am a [Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://www.de-rse.org/en/), and a Software Engineering Researcher.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Software Engineering at the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/sc/en/) and the [Department of Computer Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/).

I'm also developing software for multi-layer annotation of linguistic corpora in the [Hexatomic research project](https://hexatomic.github.io), while researching how to implement sustainable software development and maintenance in small research software projects.

My primary research interest is research software sustainability, with a current focus on
software citation.

In the past I have worked as an RSE in a number of research [projects](/projects/) in linguistics and the digital humanities, and as Managing Editor at Wiley-Blackwell.

I live in Berlin, Germany, with my partner and our three kids.
